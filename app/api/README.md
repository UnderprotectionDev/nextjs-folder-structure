# API Directory Overview

The `app/api` directory contains Next.js API Route handlers that enable creating backend endpoints within your Next.js application. These routes follow the standard Next.js API route conventions and provide server-side functionality.

## Purpose

- **Backend Integration**: Handle form submissions, database operations, and third-party service integrations
- **Security**: Process sensitive operations server-side while maintaining client-side interactivity
- **Middleware**: Implement custom middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and request validation
- **Webhook Handling**: Process incoming webhooks from external services like Stripe and Supabase
