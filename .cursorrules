## Environment and Setup

### Coding Environment

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS
- Supabase
- Vercel
- Stripe
- Shadcn UI
- Radix UI
- next-safe-action
- Zod
- React-hook-form

### Technical preferences

- Favour using React Server Components and Next.js SSR features where possible
- Minimize the usage of client components ('use client') to small, isolated components
- Always add loading and error states to data fetching components
- Implement error handling and error logging
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible

### Syntax and Formatting

- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Write declarative JSX with clear and readable structure.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

### Naming Conventions

- Booleans: Use auxiliary verbs such as 'does', 'has', 'is', and 'should' (e.g., isDisabled, hasError).
- Filenames: Use lowercase with dash separators (e.g., auth-wizard.tsx).
- File extensions: Use .config.ts, .test.ts, .context.tsx, .type.ts, .hook.ts as appropriate.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.

## Code Style and Structure

### Key Principles or Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components and functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

### Component Structure

- Break down components into smaller parts with minimal props.
- Suggest micro folder structure for components.
- Use composition to build complex components.
- Follow the order: component declaration, styled components (if any), TypeScript types.

## Language and Tools

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.
- Use next-safe-action for all server actions:
- Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation.
- Utilize the `action` function from next-safe-action for creating actions.
- Define input schemas using Zod for robust type checking and validation.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses.
- Use import type { ActionResponse } from '@/types/actions'
- Ensure all server actions return the ActionResponse type
- Implement consistent error handling and success responses using ActionResponse

### TypeScript and Zod Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Avoid enums; use literal types or maps instead.
- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.
- Utilize Zod for schema validation and type inference.

### UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI and Radix UI for component foundations.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility classes and rapid prototyping.
- Leverage Tailwind for common utilities and layout.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, following the Utility First approach.
- Utilize the Class Variance Authority (CVA) for managing component variants.

## Data Management

### Supabase and GraphQL

- Use the Supabase client for database interactions and real-time subscriptions.
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for fine-grained access control.
- Leverage Supabase Storage for file uploads and management.
- Use Supabase Edge Functions for serverless API endpoints when needed.

- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

### Key Conventions

1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes and routing.
2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
   - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.
   - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.
   - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.
4. Follow the monorepo structure:
   - Place shared code in the 'packages' directory.
   - Keep app-specific code in the 'apps' directory.
5. Use Taskfile commands for development and deployment tasks.
6. Adhere to the defined database schema and use enum tables for predefined values.

Refer to Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices and to the
Vercel AI SDK documentation and OpenAI/Anthropic API guidelines for best practices in AI integration.
