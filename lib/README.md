## USAGE

This folder is used to store reusable utility functions, helper modules and custom logic that can be shared across the application. It serves as a central place to organize non-React-specific code that supports your application logic.

## PURPOSE

- **Centralized Logic**: Contains shared functions and utilities used in multiple components or pages.
- **Code Reusability**: Encourages modular and reusable code by avoiding duplication.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps non-UI logic separate from component and page files.
